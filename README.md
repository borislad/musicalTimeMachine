#Musical Time Machine Project
###Creating a Spotify Playlist using the Musical Time Machine
##The Goal
####how music can take you back to particular time in your life as if it's just transported you.
####By listening to the same songs that were hits during that period of time.
####It was like as if I was being transported back and could relive a moment in my childhood.
####And you might have the same experience.
